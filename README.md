# Allstate AI Studio — Machine Learning Project (Break Through Tech AI)

End-to-end machine learning project completed through **Break Through Tech AI Studio (Allstate)**, focused on building a reproducible pipeline from messy real-world data to evaluated models and clear results.

---

## Overview
This project applies machine learning fundamentals to a real-world insurance/risk-style dataset. The work emphasizes building a reliable workflow: preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → reproducibility.

---

## What I Did
- Prepared **large, real-world datasets** provided through AI Studio
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Built baseline and improved **ML models** (Logistic Regression + tree-based models)
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision/Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC**
- Compared models and justified **final model selection**
- Organized work in a **reproducible Jupyter Notebook** workflow

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Machine learning workflow design (data → features → model → metrics)
- Scikit-learn modeling and evaluation
- Feature engineering + preprocessing best practices
- Model comparison and error analysis
- Clear documentation and reproducible results

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

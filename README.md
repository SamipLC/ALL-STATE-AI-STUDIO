## 📌 Project Overview


This project was completed as part of Break Through Tech AI Studio in collaboration with Allstate. The objective was to apply machine learning techniques to a realistic industry problem while following best practices for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

The project emphasizes:
- Translating raw, messy data into meaningful features
- Selecting appropriate models for structured data
- Evaluating models beyond simple accuracy metrics
- Ensuring reproducibility and clear documentation

The skills developed through this project are directly applicable to real-world data science and machine learning roles, particularly in insurance, risk modeling, and large-scale analytics.
